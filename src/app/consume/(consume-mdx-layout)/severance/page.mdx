I've got a bad habit. Once a show exhausts my ability to suspend disbelief (e.g.
call bullshit), I start mashing -> (fast forward). Read captions, ->, repeat. \
\
I think I picked this up while watching subbed anime, where it was always faster
to read the captions and move on, rather than listen to dialogue in a language I
couldn't understand. Of course, I don't fast forward during an interesting scene
or a climatic moment, but I have no trouble in fast-forwarding past side
character #3 chatting with side character #4 (just show me the cool fights,
yah?). I've been told that this behavior is very "iPad kid of me."\
\
Long-winded introduction now said, I think that summarizes how I felt about
Severance, seasons one and two. Great show with great highs, but about 6 or 7
episodes into season one, it started to feel like it was dragging (not to
mention how it does take a moment to ramp up at the start too). Admittedly, I
binged the show (season one in one day, season two on another), so my experience
was likely different than most watching week-by-week. Still, I think my appetite
for drip-fed mystery is pretty smallâ€”F.N.A.F. and Gravity Falls have fed me
plenty... \
\
Still, would highly recommend.
