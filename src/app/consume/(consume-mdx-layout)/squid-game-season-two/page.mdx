Strong season, watched all 7 episodes in one go. Not as strong as the first
season (although I think that can be excused, as the novelty isn't present
anymore), but this season's highs more than live up to season one.

## I Liked The Characters

### The Recruiter

<MdxImage
    src={Roulette}
    alt="Russian Roulette with the Recruiter"
    caption="Gong Yoo? Would."
/>

Never-racking scene. Did I ever think that 456 would die? No. Still, there's
nothing like hearing the click of an empty chamber against a skull (or
[foot](https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/Russian_Roulette)).

### Player 120

<MdxImage
    src={Player120}
    alt="Player 120"
    caption="🐐"
/>

Totally badass, totally subverted my expectations. I'm a fan.

### The Staircase

Not a character, per se, but I thoroughly love how this set piece was repurposed
in season two. Grrat action in a familiar setting.
