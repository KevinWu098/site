# There Is No Antimemetics Division

A thoroughly fantastic read. There Is No Antimemetics Division is a genuinely
riveting story set in the
[SCP universe](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/universe-hub) which weaves multiple
short stories into a narrative progression that inducts readers into just one
sliver of the vast world it inhabits. \

Having spent quite a hiatus from picking up a book, I'm grateful to
[TPOT](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/tpot-postrat) for being vocal
proponents of this novel and influencing me to pick it up.
