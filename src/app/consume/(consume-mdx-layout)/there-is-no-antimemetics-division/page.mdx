I'm not a fantastic writer. I previously wrote a different blurb that was much
more... "not great" (eloquently put, I know). For posterity, it's still
available <Link href={"/legacy/there-is-no-antimemetics-division"}
target="\_blank">here</Link>.

<blockquote>
    An antimeme is an idea with self-censoring properties; an idea which, by its
    intrinsic nature, discourages or prevents people from spreading it.

There Is No Antimemetics Division was the first book I read in a good, long
while. It drew me in, it made me _hate_ putting it down to attend to other
chores, and it made me want to write about it.

I think what I loved about the book is that not only is its premise seriously
unique, but that even though it's set in the behemoth
[SCP universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation), `qntm` (the
author) incredibly good at inducting you into just the specific slice of the SCP
world that it needs. The
[first short story](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five)
is frankly amazing.

I'll admit, though, that I preferred the first few short stories more than their
later counterparts. The first few stand on their own, being super engaging while
creating and building upon shared story threads. The later stories, charged with
concluding those threads, I think struggled a little more to deliver a cohesive.
coherent ending (not unsatisfying, mind you). A little akin to pre-Endgame and
post-Endgame Marvel, I think...
