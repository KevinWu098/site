A thoroughly fantastic read. There Is No Antimemetics Division is a genuinely
riveting story set in the
[SCP universe](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/universe-hub) which weaves multiple
short stories into a narrative progression that inducts readers into just one
sliver of the vast world it inhabits. The book -- based around the concept of a
self-censoring idea -- creates an experience which bends the mind, making it
feel all the more rewarding with every encountered revelation.

Having spent quite a hiatus from picking up a book, I'm grateful to
[TPOT](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/tpot-postrat) for being vocal
proponents of this novel and influencing me to give it a read. It's rare to find
something that viscerally tugs at your mind when you have to set it down, urging
you to return for "just one more ~~turn~~ page". Even after having read the
story fully, it remains immensely rewarding on reread and evokes a sort of
"ah-ha" moment as you retread the path the characters take. \

I would highly recommend reading at least the first of the short stories
[here](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five), on the
SCP Foundation site. And at the risk of getting too "meta", but in the process
of writing this prior sentence, I reread the story and was still every bit as
enthralled by the writing.
